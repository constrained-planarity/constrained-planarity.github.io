A level graph is level planar if it admits a level planar drawing.\n\n\nComplexity\nJ√ºnger, Leipert, and Mutzel (1998) give a linear-time algorithm for testing level planarity. While the dissertation by Leipert (1998) describes a prototypical implementation, no implementations exist of this algorithm. Br√ºckner (2021) gives an alternative linear-time algorithms and points out some issues with the algorithm by J√ºnger, Leipert, and Mutzel (1998). Simpler algorithms with a super-linear runtime have been proposed (Harrigan and Healy 2007; Randerath et al. 2001; Br√ºckner, Rutter, and Stumpf 2022; Fulek et al. 2012). For these, we could only find an implementation by Estrella-Balderrama, Fowler, and Kobourov (2010) for the quadratic algorithm by Harrigan and Healy (2007).\n\n\nRelated Problems\nTrivially reduces to Proper Clustered Level Planarity by making the instances proper (i.e., inserting subdivision vertices on edges spanning multiple levels) and adding all vertices to the same (root-)cluster (Da Lozzo 2015, Theorem 7.4).\nReduces to Strip Planarity by converting each level to three strips and subdividing the edges appropriately (Da Lozzo 2015, Theorem 9.3).\nReduces to Radial Level Planarity by adding a single edge that spans from the lowest to the highest level, at which the radial drawing can be cut to a planar one (Schaefer 2013, Lemma 6.12).\n\n\nSee Also\n\nPlanarity Variants for Directed Graphs Br√ºckner (2021)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nBr√ºckner, Guido. 2021. ‚ÄúPlanarity Variants for Directed Graphs.‚Äù PhD thesis, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Germany. https://nbn-resolving.org/urn:nbn:de:101:1-2021080405022988868936.\n\n\nBr√ºckner, Guido, Ignaz Rutter, and Peter Stumpf. 2022. ‚ÄúLevel-Planarity: Transitivity Vs.

    "text": "Definition\n\n\n\nA graph is cluster planar if there is a planar drawing of it where we can also add its clusters as closed regions that only cross the edges that leave the respective cluster.\nFormally, given a graph \\(G=(V,E)\\) equipped with a cluster hierarchy \\(T\\), which is a rooted tree with the vertices \\(V\\) as leaves. Each inner node \\(\\mu\\) of \\(T\\) represents a cluster encompassing all leaves \\(V_\\mu\\) of the subtree rooted at \\(\\mu\\). A cluster planar drawing is a planar drawing that also maps every cluster \\(\\mu\\) to a simple closed region \\(R_\\mu\\) such that\n\n\\(R_\\mu\\) encloses exactly the vertices \\(V_\\mu\\),\nno two cluster region boundaries intersect, and\nno edge intersects the boundary of a cluster more than once. A cluster graph is cluster planar if it admits a cluster planar drawing.\n\n\n\nBackground\nLengauer (1989) studied and solved this problem as early as 1989 in the setting where the clusters are connected. Feng, Cohen, and Eades (1995), who coined the term Clustered Planarity, rediscovered this algorithm and asked the general question where disconnected clusters are allowed. This question remained open for 30 years. In that time, polynomial-time algorithms were found for many special-cases (Angelini and Da Lozzo 2019; Cortese et al. 2008; Fulek et al. 2015; Gutwenger et al. 2002) before Fulek and T√≥th (2022) found an \\(O((n+d)^8)\\) solution in 2019, where \\(d\\) is the number of crossings between a cluster-border and an edge leaving the cluster. Subsequently, Bl√§sius, Fink, and Rutter (2023) gave a solution via Synchronized Planarity with a running time of \\(O((n+d)^2)\\), which also reveals the main concepts for solving Clustered Planarity.\n\n\nComplexity\nLet \\(d\\) be the number of edge-cluster boundary crossings and \\(\\Delta\\) be the maximum number of edges crossing a single cluster border. While there are no direct solutions to the problem, Clustered Planarity can be solved in time‚Ä¶\n\n\\(O((n+d)^2)\\subset O(n^4)\\) via Synchronized Planarity (Bl√§sius, Fink, and Rutter 2023)\n\\(O(n+d\\cdot \\Delta)\\subset O(n^4)\\) via Synchronized Planarity with SPQR-node expansion (Fink and Rutter 2023)\n\\(O((n+d)^8)\\subset O(n^{16})\\) via Atomic Embeddability (Fulek and T√≥th 2022)\n\nAll these reductions use the cd-Tree representation of Clustered Planarity (Bl√§sius and Rutter 2016). As the reduction subdivides an edge for each cluster boundary it crosses, the representation has size \\(O(n+d)\\).\n \nClustered Planarity also reduces to SEFE-2 by representing the cluster boundary, where the order of edges leaving needs to correspond to the order of the same edges entering, via a gadget (Schaefer 2013, Theorem 6.17; see also Rutter 2020, sec. 13.2.2).\n\\(\\langle \\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma \\rangle\\)-drawings are a generalization of Clustered Planarity, where given counts of edge-edge, cluster-cluster, and cluster-edge crossings are allowed (Angelini et al. 2015).\n\n\nSee also\n\nWikipedia Article\nHandbook on Graph Drawing and Visualization (Patrignani 2013, sec. 1.8.2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nAngelini, Patrizio, and Giordano Da Lozzo. 2019. ‚ÄúClustered Planarity with Pipes.‚Äù Algorithmica 81 (6): 2484‚Äì2526. https://doi.org/10.1007/s00453-018-00541-w.\n\n\nAngelini, Patrizio, Giordano Da Lozzo, Giuseppe Di Battista, Fabrizio Frati, Maurizio Patrignani, and Vincenzo Roselli. 2015. ‚ÄúRelaxing the Constraints of Clustered Planarity.‚Äù Computational Geometry 48 (2): 42‚Äì75. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.comgeo.2014.08.001.\n\n\nBl√§sius, Thomas, Simon D.

    "text": "Definition\nRadial Level Planarity is a generalization of Level Planarity where levels are not represented by axis-parallel lines, but by concentric rings. Equivalently, this can be seen as drawing the horizontal levels on a standing torus instead of in the plane.\n\n\nComplexity\nTesting level planarity can be reduced to the radial variant by introducing an edge from the lowest to the highest level, at which the cylinder can be cut to transform a radial solution back into the plane. Bachmaier et al.¬†give a linear-time algorithm for testing radial level planarity Bachmaier, Brandenburg, and Forster (2005). While the dissertation by Bachmaier (2004) describes a prototypical implementation, no implementations exist of this algorithm. Br√ºckner (2021) points out some issues with the algorithm by Bachmaier, Brandenburg, and Forster (2005). A simple polynomial-time algorithm is suggested by Br√ºckner, Rutter, and Stumpf (2022).\n\n\nRelated Problems\nReduces to Clustered Planarity by interpreting the concentric levels (including all levels below) as clusters (Schaefer 2013, Lemma 6.18).\n\n\nSee Also\n\nPlanarity Variants for Directed Graphs (Br√ºckner 2021)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nBachmaier, Christian. 2004. ‚ÄúCircle Planarity of Level Graphs.‚Äù PhD thesis, University of Passau, Germany. http://www.opus-bayern.de/uni-passau/volltexte/2004/38/index.html.\n\n\nBachmaier, Christian, Franz-Josef Brandenburg, and Michael Forster. 2005. ‚ÄúRadial Level Planarity Testing and Embedding in Linear Time.‚Äù Journal of Graph Algorithms and Applications 9 (1): 53‚Äì97. https://doi.org/10.7155/jgaa.00100.\n\n\nBr√ºckner, Guido. 2021. ‚ÄúPlanarity Variants for Directed Graphs.‚Äù PhD thesis, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Germany. https://nbn-resolving.org/urn:nbn:de:101:1-2021080405022988868936.\n\n\nBr√ºckner, Guido, Ignaz Rutter, and Peter Stumpf. 2022. ‚ÄúLevel-Planarity: Transitivity Vs.

    "text": "Definition\nIn Partially Embedded Planarity we are given a prescribed planar drawing of a subgraph and want to know whether this drawing can be planarly extended by adding some further edges.\nFormally, the undirected graph \\(G=(V,E)\\) is accompanied by a prescribed subgraph \\(H\\) for which a planar embedding \\(\\mathcal H\\) is given. The triplet \\((G, H, \\mathcal H)\\) is often called partially embedded graph (PEG). We call a planar embedding \\(\\mathcal G\\) of \\(G\\) an extension of the embedding \\(\\mathcal H\\) of \\(H\\) if the restriction of \\(\\mathcal G\\) to \\(H\\) coincides with \\(\\mathcal H\\). The problem Partially Embedded Planarity asks whether such an extension exists for a PEG.\n\n\nComplexity\nAngelini et al. (2015) give a linear-time algorithm for testing Partially Embedded Planarity. A simpler linear-time algorithm is given by Fink, Rutter, and T.¬†P. (2023).\n\n\nRelated Problems\nThe problem can reduced to Clustered Planarity by fixing the embedding of \\(\\mathcal H\\) using wheels and using clusters to fix the endpoints of the edges of \\(G\\setminus H\\) to their vertices and to ensure that these edges are embedded in the correct faces (diss?).\nSchaefer gives a reduction to SEFE-2, where \\(G\\) constitutes the one exclusive graph and the other exclusive graph is obtained by triangulating \\(\\mathcal H\\) (Schaefer 2013, Theorem 6.2.).\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nAngelini, Patrizio, Giuseppe Di Battista, Fabrizio Frati, Vƒ±ÃÅt Jelƒ±ÃÅnek, Jan Kratochvƒ±ÃÅl, Maurizio Patrignani, and Ignaz Rutter. 2015. ‚ÄúTesting Planarity of Partially Embedded Graphs.‚Äù ACM Transactions on Algorithms 11 (4): 32:1‚Äì42. https://doi.org/10.1145/2629341.\n\n\nFink, Simon D., Ignaz Rutter, and Sandhya T.¬†P. 2023. ‚ÄúA Simple Partially Embedded Planarity Test Based on Vertex-Addition.‚Äù In To Appear.\n\n\nSchaefer, Marcus. 2013. ‚ÄúToward a Theory of Planarity: Hanani-Tutte and Planarity Variants.‚Äù Journal of Graph Algorithms and Applications 17 (4): 367‚Äì440. https://doi.org/10.7155/jgaa.00298."
