:::

Given a graph $G=(V,E)$ equipped with a cluster hierarchy $T$, which is a rooted tree with the vertices $V$ as leaves.
Each inner node $\mu$ of $T$ represents a *cluster* encompassing all leaves $V_\mu$ of the subtree rooted at $\mu$.
A cluster planar drawing is a planar drawing that also maps every cluster $\mu$ to a simple closed region $R_\mu$ such that
1. $R_\mu$ encloses exactly the vertices $V_\mu$,
2. no two cluster region boundaries intersect, and
3. no edge intersects the boundary of a cluster more than once.
A cluster graph is cluster planar if it admits a cluster planar drawing.

## Background

@Lengauer1989Hierarchical first discussed Clustered Planarity under a different name, which is why it was later independently rediscovered by @Feng1995Planarity.
Both gave polynomial-time algorithms for the case where the subgraph induced by any cluster is connected.
While efficient algorithms were found for many other special cases @Angelini2019 @Cortese2008 @Fulek2015 @Gutwenger2002, it took almost 30 years until @Fulek2022Atomic found an $O((n+d)^8)$ solution to the general problem in 2019.
Subsequently, Bl√§sius et al. @Blaesius2021 gave a solution with a running time of $O((n+d)^2)$, which also reveals the main concepts for solving Clustered Planarity.

## Complexity

Let $d$ be the number of edge-cluster boundary crossings and $\Delta be the maximum number of edges crossing a single cluster border.
Clustered Planarity can be solved in time...

- $O(n+d\cdot \Delta)\subset O(n^4)$ via Synchronized Planarity with SPQR-node expansion
- $O((n+d)^2)\subset O(n^4)$ via Synchronized Planarity
- $O((n+d)^8)\subset O(n^{16})$ via Atomic Embeddability
