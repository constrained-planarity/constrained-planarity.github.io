In the constrained planarity setting, we ask whether a graph can be drawn such that no edges cross
and that some given further constraints are satisfied. Click on one of the problem variants below
to explore what these constraints may look like, or read more about this website on the [About](about.qmd) page.

```{python}
#| output: asis
from scripts.hierarchy import dot
print("`"*3 + "{dot}")
print("//| fig-width: NaN")
print("//| fig-height: NaN")
dot()
print("`"*3)
```

```{python}
# dot()
```

This hierarchy was initially suggested by Schaefer @Schaefer2013Theory and later extended by Da Lozzo @DaLozzo2015Planar.
